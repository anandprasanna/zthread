ZThread is a set of utilities written in Python to make use of four body potentials in 3D protein structures.

The project has a custom PDB Parser to account for the subpar parser included in Biopython.

Requirements:
Python 2.6+
Numpy 1.5+
Scipy 0.9+
Biopython 1.57+ (only for NCBI Entrez and sequence parsers, the current implementation includes a fasta parser that probably should be outdated [Biopython's sequence parsers are excellent.])

Python 3.x support was included, but was removed due to incompatibilities.

Current Features:
- PDB parsing into a simple list of atoms
- Delaunay tessellation of a set of atoms
- Support for specific spans, chains, and atom names
- Support for missing residues
- Allows trimming of gaps in multiple sequence alignments
